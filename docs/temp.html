    To create a Javascript interface object that can communicate with Swift, you will need to use WKWebView’s JavaScript Interface feature. 
    This feature allows you to create a “bridge” between your JavaScript code and Swift.

    In your ViewController.swift class, you will need to add a new property for the Javascript bridge, for example:

    swift<br>private var javascriptBridge: WKUserContentController!<br>


    Then in your viewDidLoad function, you can add some initialization for the bridge.<br>

    swift<br>javascriptBridge = WKUserContentController()<br>webView.configuration.userContentController = javascriptBridge<br>

    Now to add a method from JavaScript to Swift, you will use the addScriptMessageHandler method of the WKUserContentController object.<br> 
    This takes two parameters, one is the name of the message that you want to send from JavaScript, and the other is an object which adopts<br>
     the WKScriptMessageHandler protocol, which contains your handler code.

    For example, if you wanted to call a method called “showAlert” from JavaScript with a parameter called “message” which you<br>
    would use to set the text in an alert, you could do something like this:
    <br><br>
    swift<br>javascriptBridge.addScriptMessageHandler(self, name: "showAlert")<br>
    <br><br>
    And your handler code in ViewController.swift would look something like this:

    if message.name == "showAlert" {<br> if let message = message.body as? String {<br> 
        let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Alert from JavaScript!",<br> 
        message: message,<br> 
        preferredStyle: .alert)<br> 
        alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .default))<br> 
        self.present(alertController, animated: true)<br> }<br> }<br>}<br>
<br><br>
Now you can call this showAlert method from your JavaScript code:

javascript<br>
<br>
window.webkit.messageHandlers.showAlert.postMessage("Hello from JavaScript!");<br>
<br>

You can repeat this process to create additional methods and messages that can be sent between JavaScript and <br><br>
