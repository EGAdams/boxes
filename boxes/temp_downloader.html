    <h1>Downloader Object</h1>
    <p>The <code>Downloader</code> object is responsible for managing download tasks, reporting download progress, and handling completion and error events.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3><code>startDownload(url: URL, identifier: String)</code></h3>
<p>This method starts a download task with the given URL and identifier. It should set up the URLSession with the appropriate configuration and delegate, and then start the download task.</p>

<h3><code>cancelDownload(identifier: String)</code></h3>
<p>This method cancels the download task associated with the given identifier. It should handle any necessary clean-up and notify any interested components of the cancellation.</p>

<h3><code>urlSession(_:task:didCompleteWithError:)</code></h3>
<p>This delegate method is called when a URLSession task has completed with or without an error. It should handle any necessary clean-up, update the UI components, and notify any interested components of the completion status.</p>

<h3><code>urlSession(_:downloadTask:didWriteData:totalBytesWritten:totalBytesExpectedToWrite:)</code></h3>
<p>This delegate method is called periodically during a download task to report progress. It should handle updating any UI components that display the download progress and notify any interested components of the updated progress.</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p>Here are some potential improvements to better adhere to SOLID principles and best practices:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Implement a custom error type for better error management and provide more informative error messages. This will make it easier to handle errors and improve overall robustness.</li>
    <li><strong>Delegate Pattern:</strong> Implement a delegate pattern to better handle communication between the <code>Downloader</code> class and other components in the app, such as view controllers or other managers. This will improve separation of concerns and make the class more reusable.</li>
    <li><strong>Dependency Injection:</strong> Use dependency injection to provide required dependencies, such as a logger or a file manager, rather than hardcoding them within the class. This will improve testability and maintainability.</li>
    <li><strong>Progress Reporting:</strong> Implement a progress reporting mechanism to better handle reporting download progress to interested components. This can be achieved by using the built-in <code>Progress</code> class or a custom progress reporting solution.</li>
    <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Make sure the <code>Downloader</code> class is thread-safe by protecting access to shared resources using synchronization mechanisms like locks or dispatch queues. This will prevent potential issues related to concurrent access and improve overall stability.</li>
</ul>
